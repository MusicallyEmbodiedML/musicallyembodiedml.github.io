Before the project officially began,  Chris presented a prototype at the [Sussex AI launch event](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/63436).  It was a DiffLogic network running on an RP2040 microcontroller (hosted on a uSEQ module). The network listened to patterns of kickdrums and improvised drum patterns around this.
