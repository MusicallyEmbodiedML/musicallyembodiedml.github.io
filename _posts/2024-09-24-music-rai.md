Andrea presented the project at the [Music RAI](https://nickbknickbk.github.io/MusicRAI/) workshop at QMUL, on ethical and responsible music making, and bias in AI music generation.

The organisers reported:

>'We brought together over 100 people to form an interdisciplinary community of musicians, academics, and stakeholders to collaboratively identify the potential and challenges for using low-resource models and small datasets in musical practice. The workshop consisted of publicly streamed discussion panels, presentations of participantsâ€™ work, and brainstorming sessions on the future of AI and marginalised music. The event was followed by an evening reception featuring live performances sing AI and small datasets of music.'

Here are the slides from the presentation:
