We've been working on some tech groundwork, and making a prototype synth.  It uses machine learning to map from a 3D parameter space (a 3D joystick) into a bigger parameter space of an FM synth.  The prototype has controls for collecting training data, and for training the model. In the background, it uses an XMOS chip to run the neural network and the sound synthesis.
