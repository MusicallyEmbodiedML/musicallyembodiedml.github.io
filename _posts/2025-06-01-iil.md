Chris and Andrea recent spent a week in Iceland, visiting Thor Magnusson's [Intelligent Instruments Lab](https://iil.is) at the University of Reykjavik.  Following our participatory design method, we spent the week working with Tom Manoury, exploring the augmentation of a euphonium using our MEMLNaut technology. We also working with Stefanos Vasilakis, who used the PAF synthesis MEMLNaut patch with external synth hardware. The week culminated in performances at Mengi, with the addition a duet with Andrea and Betty Accorsi on sax, and a Brain Dead Ensemble style trio with Thor Magnusson playing the Threnoscope, Chris playing MEMLNaut/Xiasri and Betty playing sax.
