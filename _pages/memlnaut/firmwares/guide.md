There are several firmwares available, to configure the MEMLNaut in different modes: with varied approaches to signal processing and machine learning.

Each firmware is downloadable as a ```.uf2``` file.  To install a firmware:

1. Connect the MEMLNaut to your computer.
2. Put the MEMLNaut into boot select mode: press ```reset``` while holding down the ```boot select``` button.
3. The microcontroller will now appear as a drive on your computer; drag the ```.uf2``` file onto this drive.
4. The firmware will now upload, and the MEMLNaut will reboot with the new firmware running.
